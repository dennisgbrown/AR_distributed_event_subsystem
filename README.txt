pd*.java -- I developed various pieces of code on a small team building a wearable Augmented Reality systems called BARS. The code was predominantly Java with some native libraries for using OpenGL and JSAF and so on. One of my main contributions was to extend our homegrown object and event mechanism to share objects between participants on the Internet. These pieces represent the manager code for these objects and the various event transport mechanisms.  

SAFBridgeObject.java -- part of the above project, this architecture made it straightforward to connect BARS to other military simulator protocols including DIS and JointSAF.

This code sample is an extract of a larger system and is therefore not executable as presented.

From 2000.
